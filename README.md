Stiebel Eltron HTTP is a Home Assistant integration that connects and scrapes your Stiebel Eltron ISG webserver to retrieve data, as HA sensors.

It is not meant to be a climate entity and thus cannot set the temperatures, change the modes, etc. See the official HA integration for that - but you'll need to find a way to activate Modbus on your ISG.

NB: both integrations can run in the same HA instance.
